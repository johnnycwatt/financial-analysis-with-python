# financial-analysis-with-python

The sole purpose of this repository is to practice Financial Analysis using Python.

I intend to practice working with Python Libraries including Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, SciPy and StatsModels

I will be uploading a few programs I have been working on that relate to Financial Analysis. 
For example generating Simple Moving Averages of Stock Prices, or programs that can predict the price change of the SPY or a certain stock to give us a recommendation if we should go long or short on a stock.

The results provided by these programs, should not be taken as Financial Advice. As these programs are solely for the purpose of practicing Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, using Multiple Linear Regression and Creating simple prediction models using Financial Data such as Historical Stock Prices or Real Estate Prices.
