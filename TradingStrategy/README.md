For this strategy, we will need to determine the 10 day Moving Average (MA10), and the 50 day Moving Average (MA50) of our selected stock price.

The Moving Average is often used by traders to determine the trend of a stock price.

Our strategy is, if the MA10 is higher than the MA50 we will buy and hold one share of that stock.
Alternatively, if the MA50 is higher than the MA10 we will sell that one share.

Finally, we will compare the performace of our strategy with the "Buy and Hold" strategy, a form of passive investing where we buy the stock and hold onto it over the long term
