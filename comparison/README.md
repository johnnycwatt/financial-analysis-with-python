The purpose of this program is to compare two stocks that the user selects.

First, the user is asked to select two stocks and an initial investment (eg. $1000)

Then we compare the two stocks by determining what the value of our investment would be if we had invested in either stock over a one year period and a five year period.
The current value of either investment is then printed out, and displayed in a graph in order to make comparisons. 

Examples have been included in the Examples directory.
